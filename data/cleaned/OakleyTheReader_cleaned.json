You should always have one damaging cantrip in your build. That's your go-to attack when you are low on resources or just want to conserve resources. Plus most (but not all) damage cantrips are ranged, so you don't have to get up close like you do with daggers. It's very common for casters to use their damage cantrip quite a bit, mixing in higher level spells as needed based on the fight.",

How long of a fight are you usually in? What’s the rest of your party playing? \n\nI’m currently level 13 and am at the point where my DM sometimes has to double check I’m not cheating because of the SHEER VOLUME of high level spells I can put out. This is due to having meta magic adept, a blood well vial, a ring of spell storing, and a staff of power but even at lower levels you should feel like you have enough spells to get through a single combat.\n\nThe only thing I can think of without knowing your subclass and spell list is that what spells you are using aren’t being as effective as they should be, my friend you are a Sorcerer, you are magic incarnate, when you drop a spell it should affect (effect?) the battle in a lasting and meaningful way even at low levels so if you feel you aren’t having that happen maybe it’s not the amount of spells you are casting you need to look at but WHAT spells\n\nSo if you have a chance to post your spell list I’d love to see it and maybe we can come up with some ideas to give you more longevity, but at your level something like sleep should be absolutely destroying half of your combats with a single cast",

Some encounters may even be fine with you only casting Cantrips. I know it feels bad comparing to spells but on level 5 it will be more manageable (Cantrips double their dices). Another thing is that you can trade your spells slots for Sorcerer Points and other way around. This combined with Metamagick Adept feat from Tasha’s can give you some more options and breathing room in terms of spell slots.  \n \n\nI also think that Sorc works best as a part of multiclassing character. Me for example play Death Domain Cleric 1/Divine Soul Sorcerrer and I am having a blast!",

      "context": ">how to make sorcerer more enduring that isn't just simply having a crumb of self control.\n\nLet's flip the perpsective entirely. \n\nThis is not a question of 'self-control'. Instead, it is a question of **greed**. You want to get *value* out of your spells, so isntead of needing self-control to hold back, you need self-control to not *wait for a better time*.\n\nYour dream scenario in a fight is to cast 1 spell, often a concentration spell (Sleep, Web, Hypnotic Pattern, Fear, Confusion, Wall of Force, etc) that hopefully controls a large group of enemies, and decisively flips the battle in your favour.  And, when you tart a fight, you should think greedily think \"ooh, maybe I'll save my level 3 spell slot for then ext fight *in case it is a bigger fight*, and I'll just use a level 2 slot for this fight.\"\n\nBut eventually you will use your big spell. For instance, if you use Hypnotic Pattern to knock out half the enemies, then that makes the rest of your party have somewhere between a 2x or 4x times easier task to win the battle. You then sit back and protect yourself in an effort to keep concentration on, so that the battle stays easy.\n\nThis is not self-control, this is the satisfaction of crushing foes with ease by controlling the flow of battle, and greedily getting the most power out of your spell slots as possible.\n\nNow, obviously, we won't manage to have every fight go so smoothly. \n\n* The enemies might not be grouped up for our control spell.\n* Someone might break our concentration, requiring us to recast.\n* A fight might be tough, and require us to invest more power.\n\nBut instead of thinking it in terms of us excercising self-control, think of it as our opponents being such a nuisiance that we have to lift another finger.\n\nLike, suppose you do land a Hypnotic Pattern on turn 1, but halfway through the fight you get hit. Well, you'd invest a Shield spell to try to keep concentration at this point. Maybe they hit you again and you lose concentration. Well, maybe you follow up with a Web to tie up some of the peopel that just woke up. \n\n-----\n\nNow, in some cases we might deviate from the above.\n\n* Like at level 5&6, as a sorcerer, you probably should be using Fireball in stead of Hypnotic Pattern - killing the enemies dead is a more effective control option than hypnotising them. However, later on in our career, Hyptnoic Pattern will likely be more effective.\n* And arguably at level 3, the new 2024 Cloud of Daggers competes with Web as a damage option isntead of control, although still as a long-term concentration for potentailly the whole fight.\n* And maybe the 2024 Sleep isn't a strong early-game spell anymore due to its smaller range, so your 'control' options at level 1&2 are limited.\n\nBut if you gradually shift to this approach of 'greeding' for a bigger spell effect, that might help. \n\nIt shouldn't be the only paradigm you use, but switching to it for a while might help you balance out your tendency to burn through slots ASAP.",
      "text": "This is actually an amazing comment, thank you for the explanation! I do think there's also an issue of foresight, because saving up a powerful spell for later use and then long resting with a lvl3 spell slot feels very bad, but I guess its better than being unprepared in that respect."
