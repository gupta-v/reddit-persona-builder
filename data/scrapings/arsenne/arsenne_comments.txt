i believe he says in one of his lectures that the nclex will change about 10% every 4 years. anyone know wonder how it actually changes, besides new question styles? surely the concepts we need to know wont change much.

i’ve been hearing this all my life. that kibbles dont clean their teeth at all. i just want to rant about my personal experience because i’m feeling really guilty as a cat owner rn. 

so i feed my two boy cats exclusively wet food diet. they’ve never touched kibbles in their life before.
they are now 2 years old. ive tried brushing their teeth time to time but you know how it goes, it felt almost impossible. they hated it so much. so honestly i sorta just gave up. (biggest mistake of my life)

Quoted comment: "Gingivitis is not caused by wet food. Some cats have worse teeth than others due to genetics. Some wet foods are worse than others due to their ingredient list (looking at you, Fancy Feast). If you are feeding a high quality wet food, the bad teeth are most likely due to genetics.. which would make it even more imperative that you figure out how to give them regular brushings.

Anecdotally, two of my cats are litter mates that I’ve had since they were 6 weeks old. One had her first dental at 2 years old and again at 4 years because her teeth were horrible.. the other at 5 years old still has perfect teeth. Both have the exact same diet and lifestyle but completely different mouths."
Reply: can you elaborate on which ingredients make fancy feast bad for teeth and what other ingredients to look out for when looking at cat food? is it the wheat gluten and gravy? genuinely curious!

→ arsenne commented on post (2025-04-21T20:42:37+00:00)
Besides the other comments here, I want to add that social media (especially tiktok) is like an echo chamber. Negative stories about nurses are amplified and seem like they happen FREQUENTLY. Don’t get me wrong, these things do happen, but this is why you’re in nursing school! You’re learning all of these things and practicing these skills so that you become a competent nurse. Nursing school is rigorous for a reason, they don’t pass you unless they believe you will be a safe and competent nurse. 

You will develop those soft skills (like learning to take care of yourself, maturing, etc that you mentioned) with time. Hell, there are older adults who still feel like  they don’t have their life together. For me, I feel like some of my classes taught me how to take better care of myself. I learned from past exams and learned how to study better in the future. Your experience in nursing school is what you make of it, and as long as you’re willing to learn and grow, that’s all that matters!

How are y’all’s college life as nursing majors? I want my college life to be the absolute best it can be: amazing night life, going out, parties(praying it will acc be like this😭), but I’ve heard nursing is sooo time consuming . How much free time do you have?

→ arsenne commented on post (2025-03-17T18:14:56+00:00)
you can get definitely get away with it when you’re doing your prerequisites, however the workload definitely gets heavier and heavier when you get into your program. you unfortunately will have to make some sacrifices when it comes to going out to parties, festivals, etc. and learning how to say no. but if you think about it, it’s a 1 1/2-2 year (or however long your program is) sacrifice. after you graduate, you can go all out but this time with nursing money. 

balance and self-care is important in nursing school. you need to work hard but at the same time you can’t let yourself get burnt out. time management is KEY. the better you learn how to manage your time, the more successful you’ll be.

you’ll figure it out as you go. i believe in you

It can definitely frustrate them if you don’t award them with an actual “catch” or with a treat. When I wasn’t home, my roommate would let her boyfriend use the laser pointer to play with my cat, but it was more for his entertainment than for my cat. My cat now spends a good amount of time staring at walls, especially when she sees little light reflections.

OR 

Completely finished the A&P series (1+2) and then start my first Patho class?

→ arsenne commented on post (2024-11-27T20:06:12+00:00)
I definitely recommend taking both A&P classes before taking Patho.

The way my nursing school is set up is that A&P 1/2 are both prerequisites for patho. Similar to A&P, units in Patho are divided up into body systems (ex: Diseases of the Cardiovascular, Diseases of the Endocrine, etc), so what you learn in both A&P classes will build up to Patho. 

I took a several years off school in between A&P and Patho, but was able to pass Patho doing light review on basic A&P concepts. As long as you have a good understanding of those you’ll be fine, but taking both A&P classes will make your life much easier

I’m so sorry for your loss OP. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to adopt another cat, cats in shelters need homes too! As long as you’re able to care for them properly and you’re not adopting on a whim. But take all the time you need to grieve, remember grief is not linear and everyone processes it differently.
