Just a question I had stuck on my head for a while conserning a certain sci-fi scenario, and couldn't find an answer on Google.

Vermintide 2 seems to be  the only game I've seen in my life that doesn't have a built in fps cap, is there any way to fix this without going into my Nvidia controls?

And now, Vsync won't cap it enough.

In ep7 it's mentioned the fox devil is one of "the friendlier ones" and more often makes contracts with humans, which the series implies to be very rare (we only really see two examples being the chainsaw devil, and power) but as far as I know it's never mentioned since. Do we ever get an explanation as to why some devils take up contracts instead of feasting on humans like the rest?

Built two waystations in my colonies, both have had their demands met for almost a cycle now but none of them are stockpiling anything, the weird thing is the first station I build did stockpile stuff, but only for a short while, then it stopped, second one didn't do anything at all.

Is there something I'm missing in their behavior? Is it supposed to be like this?

Relatively new player here, first time playing as pure sorcerer, and surprised by how quickly you can run out of spell slots and sorcery points, at lower levels atleast.

Within the first turn, I'm already down a second level spell slot and 3 sorcery points, my sorcerer frequently ran out of resources and had to resort to pulling out his daggers, and that's just the first encounter in the day!

I do understand this problem is probably exaggerated by the fact were still on very low levels, (level 4) and it'll probably get better with time as I get more clas resources, but there seems to be a trend unique to sorcerer that you have the means to do a lot more than other classes in an encounter, but really suffer in your endurance as a consequence, even compared to other spell casters like wiza...

So, right outside the selunite outpost, you first meat a Minotaur that tries bashing down the gate with it's head, which is good exposition for both minotaurs and the turrets, but right after that comes a Minotaur fight, they are VERY difficult for 4 level players to fight outright, but bg3 is a great game in which you can approach problems with a lot of tools on hand, do I thought with a creative approach the minotaur fight will be fun and easy!

So, I gathered 5 oil barrels in the selunite outpost, and placed them at the gates, then I went and triggered the fight, after which all my party members drank speed potions and ran back to the outpost, astarion shut the gates once everyone was inside and gale put grease Infront of the gate, my PC and Wyll stood on the high ground and prepared to...

So, I'm not really a writer but I felt like this would be the best place to ask.

I'm a fan of world-building, I've engaged in quite a lot of it myself, infact it has become a hobby of mine and I've grown quite proud of it (and maybe just a little arrogant too).
In recent times though, I've noticed I can't find anyone who shares the same passion for world-building as I, even though I've searched extensively, and in my search I eventually stumbled on a couple discussions about world-building  on various subreddits, all leading to the same conclusion that world-building isn't really all that useful in storytelling and it mainly serves as a way for the writer to channel their inner nerd onto an unsuspecting reader.
Many people share the idea that it is both boring to the writer and to the rea...

Hosted a server with on 1.12.2 with a couple factory mods, but upon loading the server we came into issues with significant lag, server is constantly giving me messages about being overloaded. I've tried skimping on mods, preloading the world, and disabling lost cities mob spawners, but so far nothing has worked to reduce the lag... 

Has anyone else encountered this? I have a pretty decent CPU and the server has 6 gigs of ram allocated to it, it never lagged when hosting other modpacks on never servers so I have no idea what's wrong or how to fix this without just giving up and uninstalling those two mods.

I wonder if there are any defense maps that are have severly limited resources, where you have to use slag and scrap as your primary method of getting more.

I've tried searching for some, but the best think I got was the built in molten lake map which wouldn't work for what I'm going for.

I get that this post isn't really that related to vaush, but this is the only relatively populated takie-free left sub I know of so I can't really ask anywhere else, and I also am fully aware I may be dogpilled in the comments for saying something stupid, but I've never really understood the whole cultural appropriation thing.

Is it really that bad to borrow certain aspects of other cultures even if you may be doing it incorrectly or otherwise ignorant in their ways?
I mean, I don't really see how that hurts anyone or does anything bad, especially if a person is doing it in good faith.

So, is cultural appropriation really that stupid or am I the ignorant one here? Perhaps I got the wrong definition and people don't really mean what I think they mean?
