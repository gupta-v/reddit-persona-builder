Title: "What has happened to malls like wave , one awadh and saharaganj?"

Recently went to these malls and noticed that there is no crowd. Secondly there are like empty cemeteries. Most shops are closed. Food zones look barren islands. Did lulu and pallasio snatched customers even from main land lucknow? Or is it a sign of imperceptible recession? Pls share insights.

Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand.

Body:
Today, an hour ago, I was coming back home. I was stopped before Jaripatka Market by the cops for checking. I mean, fair, it’s a weekend.

while I parked in the right position, searching for my license, there was this guy manuovering  around my car. 

Cop: Gaadi tumhare naam pe hain?
I: haan!

he made me park closer to the footpath and said “good boy” 💀

I am still searching my license, but in my email.

This random dude who was manuvering aroung says “cute boy” and asks for a lighter.

I was like “nahi hain”

continues to search for license.

Out of no where he’s like “Cute hain ye jaane do” ...

Quoted comment: "can you give me a scenario?"
Reply: I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.

Cops keep a civ around to discuss bribes.

Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps.
